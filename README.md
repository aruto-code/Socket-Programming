This C++ program demonstrates a simple server-client application for counting the frequency of a word in multiple text files. The server listens for connections on port 8080, receives JSON data from the client containing file names and a word, reads the content of each file, and counts the frequency of the specified word. It then sends the frequency information back to the client. The client reads the JSON response from the server and prints the results. The program utilizes the JSON library for parsing and formatting JSON data and socket programming for communication between the server and client.
